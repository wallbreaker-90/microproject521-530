Jaldapara national park has got great biodiversity and ecological significance as it forms the gene pool reserve for great one Horned Rhinoceros outside Assam and Nepal. The Rhino population in Jaldapara national park is a remnant of the erstwhile population inhabiting Indo-Gangetic plains which got geographically isolated due to fragmentation of habitat. As of now Jaldapara forms second largest home for critically endangered Great one-horned Rhinoceros. In addition, Jaldapara harbours herds of Bison, Hispid hare, Hog deer, Sambar and Asian elephants etc.<br>
It was declared a sanctuary in 1941 for protection of its great variety flora and fauna. Today, it has the largest population of the Indian one horned rhinoceros in the state, an animal threatened with extinction, and is a Habitat management area (Category IV).<br>
